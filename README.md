This is a personal portfolio dedicated to my youtube channel. It features a home page, about page and project page. 
On the home page you will find one of our latest vidoes and custom buttom to change the themeing of the page. 
The about page is currently a wall of text that I hope to separate in to neat bubbles. The project page is ready to be filled with information.
I have enabled paralax scrolling, and stationary/sticky headers and footers.
The header features button/links for navigation and the footer links to the channel itself.
In a future update I would like to break up and separate the css file for ease of use.
